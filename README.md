  ## ðŸŽ¯ LeetCode Problems

  ### âœ… Easy Problems
  - **Problem 136: Single Number**  
    Solution for finding the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one.

  - **Problem 1: Two Sum**  
    Solution for finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target value.

  - **Problem 169: Majority Element**  
    Solution for finding the majority element in an array that appears more than **n / 2** times.

  - **Problem 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**  
    Solution for finding the maximum profit you can make from buying and selling a stock once, given an array of prices where each element represents the price of the stock on a given day.

  - **Problem 26: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**  
    Solution for removing duplicates from a sorted array in-place such that each unique element appears only once, achieving an **O(n) time complexity** with **O(1) extra space**.

  - **Problem 374: Guess Number Higher or Lower**  
    Solution for guessing the picked number using **binary search**, reducing the search space efficiently to achieve an **O(log n) time complexity**.

  - **Problem 704: Binary Search**  
    Solution for implementing **binary search** on a sorted array to find a target element, achieving an **O(log n) time complexity**.

  ### ðŸ”¥ Medium Problems
  - **Problem 53: Maximum Subarray Sum**  
    Solution for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using the brute-force approach.

  - **Problem 50: Pow(x, n)**  
    Solution for calculating **x** raised to the power **n** (x^n), implementing an efficient approach using binary exponentiation to reduce the time complexity.

  - **Problem 11: Container With Most Water**  
    Solution for finding the maximum area of water that can be contained by two vertical lines, given their positions and heights. The problem is solved using the **two-pointer approach** to optimize the solution and reduce time complexity to **O(n)**.

  - **Problem 238: Product of Array Except Self**  
    Solution for computing an array where each element is the product of all other elements except itself, without using division. The problem is solved using a **prefix and suffix multiplication approach**, achieving an optimal **O(n) time complexity** with **O(1) extra space** (excluding the output array).

  - **Problem 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array**  
    Solution for searching a target value in a **rotated sorted array** using **binary search**, achieving an efficient **O(log n) time complexity**.

  - **Problem 852: Peak Index in a Mountain Array**  
    Solution for finding the peak index in a **mountain array** using **binary search**, optimizing the search process to **O(log n) time complexity**.

  - **Problem 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**  
    Solution for finding the minimum element in a **rotated sorted array** using **binary search**, achieving an efficient **O(log n) time complexity**.
