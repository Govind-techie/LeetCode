- **Problem 938: Range Sum of BST**  
  *Given a Binary Search Tree and a range \[low, high\], return the sum of all node values within that range. The problem is solved using **DFS traversal**, where we leverage the **BST property** to skip unnecessary branches. If the current node value is less than `low`, we only explore the right subtree; if it's greater than `high`, we explore only the left subtree. This approach improves efficiency over a brute-force traversal. The time complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case (unbalanced tree) and **O(log n)** on average for a balanced BST.*

- **Problem 98: Validate Binary Search Tree**  
  *Determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST).  
  A valid BST requires that for every node, all nodes in the left subtree are strictly less than the nodeâ€™s value, and all nodes in the right subtree are strictly greater than the nodeâ€™s value (no duplicates allowed).  
  The solution uses recursion with min and max constraints passed down to validate each subtree, ensuring strict inequality.  
  Time complexity: **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.*

- **Problem 108: Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree**  
  *Given a sorted array, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).  
  The solution uses the middle element of the array as the root to ensure balance, then recursively builds left and right subtrees from the left and right halves of the array respectively. This approach achieves O(n) time complexity.*

  *Given a binary matrix where each row consists of soldiers (1s) followed by civilians (0s), return the indices of the **k weakest rows** in the matrix in order from weakest to strongest.*  
  A row is weaker if it has fewer soldiers, or the same number of soldiers but a smaller index.  
  The solution uses a **min-heap (priority queue)** or sorting based on soldier count (using binary search per row) along with row index to determine the weakest rows.  
  Time complexity is **O(m Ã— log n + m log m)** where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns.

- **Problem 1207: Unique Number of Occurrences**  
  *Given an array of integers, determine if the number of occurrences of each value is unique.  
  The solution uses a hash map to count the frequency of each element, then checks if all frequencies are unique by inserting them into a hash set.  
  If any frequency repeats, return false; otherwise, return true.  
  Time complexity is **O(n)** for counting and checking uniqueness, where n is the length of the array.*

- **Problem 349: Intersection of Two Arrays**  
  *Given two arrays, find their intersection (unique elements present in both arrays).  
  The solution uses hash sets to store elements from the first array and checks for common elements in the second array, ensuring uniqueness in the result.  
  Time complexity is **O(n + m)**, where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays.*
  
- **Problem 2215: Find the Difference of Two Arrays**  
  *Given two integer arrays, return a list of two lists:  
  1. Elements present in the first array but not in the second,  
  2. Elements present in the second array but not in the first.  
  The solution uses hash sets to efficiently compute the unique differences between the arrays.  
  Time complexity is **O(n + m)**, where n and m are the lengths of the two arrays.*

- **Problem 1971: Find if Path Exists in Graph**  
  *Given an undirected graph with n nodes and a list of edges, determine if there is a valid path between two given nodes (source and destination).  
  The solution builds an adjacency list and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to check if the destination node is reachable from the source node.  
  Time complexity is **O(V + E)**, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.*

Solved using a recursive post-order traversal. If both left and right recursive calls return non-null, the current node is the LCA. Otherwise, we return whichever side is non-null. Time complexity is **O(n)** where n is the number of nodes in the tree.*

- **Problem 1382: Balance a Binary Search Tree**  
  *Given a binary search tree (BST), return a balanced BST with the same node values.*

  If multiple answers exist, the lexicographically smallest is returned.  
  Time complexity is **O(n log n + n * k)**, where n is the number of words and k is the

- **Problem 684: Redundant Connection**  
  *Given a connected undirected graph with one extra edge added to a tree, find the edge that can be removed so the resulting graph is a tree.  
  The solution incrementally adds edges and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. When a cycle is detected upon adding an edge, that edge is the redundant connection.  
  Time complexity is **O(V + E)** per edge, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.*


- **Problem 785: Is Graph Bipartite?**  
  *Given an undirected graph, determine if it is bipartite (i.e., its nodes can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color).  
  The solution uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to attempt coloring the graph and checks for conflicts. If a conflict is found, the graph is not bipartite.  
  Time complexity is **O(V + E)**, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.*

  *Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, determine if it is possible to finish all courses.  
  The solution models the problem as a directed graph and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected, it means there is a circular dependency and not all courses can be completed.

This is solved using BFS with a map to store nodes by their vertical and level indices, achieving **O(n log n)** time complexity.*

- **Problem 1305: All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees**  
  *Given two binary search trees, return a sorted list containing all the elements from both trees. Solved using inorder traversal on both trees to get sorted lists, then merging these two sorted lists efficiently with O(n + m) time complexity.*

- **Problem 239: Sliding Window Maximum**  
  *Given an array of integers and a sliding window size `k`, return the maximum value in each sliding window.*  
  The problem is solved using a **deque (double-ended queue)** to maintain the indices of potential maximum elements for the current window.  
  At each step, we remove indices from the back of the deque if the current element is greater than the elements at those indices. We also remove the front element if it is outside the current window.  
  This results in an efficient **O(n) time complexity** where n is the number of elements in the input array.
